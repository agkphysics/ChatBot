There are different kinds of        information that will be obtained by dedicated methods:</p>    <ul>        <li>Phrases identified in the text.</li>        <li>Features: identifier-value pairs extracted from the text.</li>        <li>Topics: combining phrases and features a topic can be associated to a text. A topic is a classification            of the text.</li>    </ul>    <p>Phrases and Features are stored using the objects implemented in the info subpackage. That package stores        three objects that aid in the representation of the extracted information:</p>    <ul>        <li>PhraseInfo: stores extracted phrases.</li>        <li>FeatureInfo: stores extracted features.</li>        <li>WeightedRelation: represents a weighted relation between two tokens. These relations are found by the            glossary and thesaurus methods.</li>    </ul>    <p>Following picture illustrates the hole organization:</p>    <center>        <img src="IETextRepresentationAll.jpg" />    </center></body></html>
